# Australian-Trade-Analysis-Project
## üìÑ Project Background
Australia has been a major player in global trade, engaging in the import and export of a variety of goods that drive its economy. This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of Australia‚Äôs trade data, focusing on imports and exports across key categories over several years.

The dataset captures insights into trade growth patterns, economic impacts, and category-specific trends, providing a detailed view of how global events, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic, have shaped Australia‚Äôs trade dynamics. By analyzing these trends, the project aims to identify key opportunities for optimizing trade strategies and enhancing economic stability.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

**Mineral Fuels, Lubricants, and Related Materials**: A detailed examination of this dominant export category, highlighting significant fluctuations influenced by global energy demands. Recommendations focus on strategic monitoring of market conditions to optimize export strategies.

**Machinery and Transport Equipment**: An evaluation of the consistent growth in import values for machinery, driven by technological advancements and rising domestic demand. The analysis offers guidance for potential investments in technology and infrastructure.

**Manufactured Goods**: Analysis of the steady growth in both imports and exports in this category, indicating strong global demand. Insights include recommendations for market diversification and enhanced production efficiency to strengthen this sector.

**Crude Materials, Inedible**: An exploration of the resilience of crude materials during economic downturns, particularly during the 2020 pandemic. The findings suggest investing in resource extraction technologies to maximize trade benefits and support economic stability.

An interactive Tableau dashboard is available for download, providing a visual representation of the key insights.

## üóÇÔ∏è Data Overview & Structure
The dataset includes various categories related to Australia‚Äôs trade activities, such as mineral fuels, machinery, manufactured goods, and crude materials. In addition to the original dataset, a new statistics and analytics table was created to facilitate in-depth analysis. This table includes:

‚Ä¢ **Growth Rates**: Year-over-year changes in trade values for each category.
‚Ä¢ **Aggregate Measures**: Calculated totals, averages, and percentage shares of imports and exports.
‚Ä¢¬†**Key Indicators**: Derived metrics such as growth trends, peak years, and volatility rates, which provide a detailed view of trade dynamics.


## üìå Executive Summary
Australia's trade activities have shown consistent growth over the years, with both imports and exports reflecting the country's economic strength and resilience. However, trade values experienced significant fluctuations due to global events like the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic. In 2021, total exports reached approximately 43% in mineral fuels, highlighting this category's dominance in Australia's trade.
